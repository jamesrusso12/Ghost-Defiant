# VR-MR-Project: Ghost Defiant

Ghost Defiant is a mixed reality wave-based survival shooter game developed for Meta Quest headsets using Unity Engine and Meta XR SDK. The game combines virtual reality gameplay with real-world passthrough technology, creating an immersive horror experience where ghost enemies spawn throughout the player's actual physical room. Players defend themselves using a laser gun against progressively difficult waves of intelligent ghosts that use Unity NavMesh pathfinding to navigate around room obstacles, hide when detected by the player's gaze, and attack when in close proximity. The game features advanced MR integration including room occlusion (so virtual objects outside the room don't appear inside), spatial mapping using Meta XR MR Utility Kit to automatically detect room boundaries and furniture, and a graveyard-themed virtual environment that blends seamlessly with the real-world space. Built with performance optimizations like object pooling, the game includes five progressive rounds with increasing difficulty, a scoring system, player health management, and comprehensive audio/visual feedback systems.
